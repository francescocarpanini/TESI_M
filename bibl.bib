  abstract = {Neural networks represent a brain metaphor for information processing. These models are biologically inspired rather than an exact replica of how the brain actually functions. Neural networks have been shown to be very promising systems in many forecasting applications and business classification applications due to their ability to learn from the data. This article aims to provide a brief overview of artificial neural network. The artificial neural network learns by updating the network architecture and connection weights so that the network can efficiently perform a task. It can learn either from available training patterns or automatically learn from examples or input-output relations. Neural network-based models continue to achieve impressive results on longstanding machine learning problems, but establishing their capacity to reason about abstract concepts has proven difficult. Building on previous efforts to solve this important feature of general-purpose learning systems, our latest paper sets out an approach for measuring abstract reasoning in learning machines, and reveals some important insights about the nature of generalization itself. Artificial neural networks can learn by example like the way humans do. An artificial neural net is configured for a specific application like pattern recognition through a learning process. Learning in biological systems consists of adjustments to the synaptic connections that exist between neurons. This is true of artificial neural networks as well. Artificial neural networks can be applied to an increasing number of real-world problems of considerable complexity. They are used for solving problems that are too complex for conventional technologies or those types of problems that do not have an algorithmic solution.},

abstract = { Accurate and robust vehicle localization, a fundamental task for autonomous driving, is still a challenging problem especially in GPS-denied scenarios. Recently, high definition (HD) map suggests a promising solution. However, the matching between online sensed data and HD map is difficult and time-consuming. In our work, road markings are selected as landmarks due to salient appearance features. Based on the detection results of road markings from the vehicle-borne images, the points of edge lines are employed to fit straight lines with RANSAC for outlier removal. The distances between the ego-vehicle and the fitted edge lines can be computed with camera-vehicle calibration in advance. Subsequently, the point-to-line distances from the sensed data are mapped into global linear constraints on the vehicleâs positions with the support of a lane-level HD map, which provides centimeter-level coordinates of road markings. Finally, the distances and the localization from the integrated navigation system (INS) are fused with the proposed linear Kalman filter based on the second-order Markov model (KF-MM2). The proposed method has been verified in different daily driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve good performance with an average localization error of 0.53 m and a standard deviation of 0.17 m. }
